## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

One of the challenges was navigating XCode. When the instructions told me to open the Storyboard file, I did not what it was referring to, so I had to search it on the web. Another challenge was making sure to link the button to IBAction rather than IBOutlet. Initially, I used IBOutlet and tried to follow the instructions, which did not work. So, I saw that someone else had encountered the same problem on Slack and followed the instructions presented by a TA.

## App Brainstorming
- [x] Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. Its okay if features repeat on different apps
    - Instagram
        1. Story: I like that you can view stories in addition to normal posts
        2. Reel: I like that you can view short video clips in addition to normal posts
        3. Followers and Following: I like that you can see who your friends are connected to
    - Beli
        1. Map: I like that you can map all the restaurants you've been to
        2. Rating: I like that you can see how your restaurants compare to each other
        3. Recommendations: I like that the app gives you restaurant recommendations based on your ratings
    - YouTube
        1. Thumbnail: I like that you can preview videos by focusing on the thumbnails
        2. Subscriptions: I like that you get a real-time feed of videos based on who you follow
        
- [x] Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not commiting to this idea, but it helps to start brain storming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
    - I would like to build an app that captures pieces of clothing that are in your wardrobe/closet. The app could help users who struggle to remember what is already in their closet as well as help them virtually plan outfits to wear. Additionally, this app would solve the issue of purchasing similar items. Some features I would like to implement are the following: collage of clothes, planning board, and follower-following to link users.
